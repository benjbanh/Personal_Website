                    I was taking a computer science class at the time and wanted to explore 
                    the subject and tried to make a simple physics engine with balls bouncing like 
                    a windows DVD logo. Admittedly this took a lot longer to implement than I hoped and 
                    I kept pushing updates for the project until I finally got it to a place I liked in 
                    2024. Of course it could be improved, but I feel really proud of accomplishing this 
                    as my first project."

                    with simple mechanics and a suprising depth of storytelling. This game has a typical leveling
                    system where you are given a choice to choose a skill each from 3 different catagories
                    at the start of a run and gain a new skill every level. Despite that, I thought
                    that there must be an optimal way for gaining skills to maximize my progression.
                    So this project came to be. I asked some friends for help with the problem and 
                    it somehow became one of the questions for my school's competitive programming competition.
                    This project spanned the course of a year and still remains as one of my favorites and 
                    helped me know so many great people.

                    The project was then constructed into a form with a dynamic scoring system that 
                    will predict the best build depending on your playstyle and preferences."

                    wishes to practice having a conversation without the pressure of 
                    judgement of the outside world. The companion would ask a variety 
                    of questions and would then score your response as well as provide 
                    constructive feedback to the user. This was to provide a visible 
                    metric for which the user can use to tell if they are improving 
                    opposed to having the user guess their progress or the AI's intention 
                    through conversation. To improve the learning curve for the app, we 
                    decided to also include a helper that would guide you in your 
                    conversations as well as a fun background and partner to keep users
